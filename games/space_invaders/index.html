                <h3>Objective:</h3>


                <ul>

                    <li>The objective of the game is to shoot the aliens aproaching downwards, and dodge the bullets they shoot at you.</li>

                    <li>The barriers, when struck by both player bullets or enemy bullets gets damaged until completely destroyed.</li>

                    <li>The Player ship gets destroyedwhen it is struck by the enemy bullets.</li>

                    <li>The Player gets bonus points on shooting the Red Alien Space Ship on the top.</li>
                    
                    <li>Game is Won by destroying all the enemy ships down.</li>
                    
                    <li>Game is Over when player is out of lives or if the enemies reach the player.</li>
                    
                    <li>Speed and frequency of enemy firing the bullets will increase as the enemies comes down.</li>


                </ul>

                <br /><br />
                
                <h3>How To Play:</h3>


                <ul>

                    <li>The Player ship can be moved left and right using the respective 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys.</li>

                    <li>Shoot bullets from the player ship using the 'Alt' key.</li>


                </ul>

                <br /><br />


                <h3>Logic Design and Implementation:</h3> 

                <ul>
                    <li>The whole game is constructed using the Bitmaps and square blocks</li>

                    <li>Player, enemies and enemy bullets have bitmaps, which change accordingly to show animation.</li>
                    
                    <li>Square blocks are drawn in place of '1' and nothing in place of '0' in the bitmap.</li>

                    <li>Even the Score numbers are drawn using the bitmaps.</li>

                    <li>Barriers take few bullets to get completly damaged, thus protecting the player from enemy bullets.</li>

                    <li>Bullet class is created and the bullets are reused by activating and deactivationg them, making the game efficient.</li>
                    
                    <li>Enemies movement logic is created along with their animation.</li>
                    
                    <li>Speed is common for all enemies, and this speed is increased as the time goes on. so that enemies become faster and frequency at which they fire increases.</li>
                    
                    <li>Bitmap of Barrier is altered to show damage.</li>

                </ul></ul></ul>

        </p>

    <br /><br /></br>

<h3>Scope for improvement:</h3>

<ul><li> Implement Audio to the game.</ul>
